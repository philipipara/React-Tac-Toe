This was a simple Tick-Tac-Toe game that I made to understand mapping a little more thoroughly. Although it such a simple application I felt
I learned a lot on the logic side of what is happening. The application lets you know whose turn it is and then you go from there clicking squares
until there is a winner or becomes a tie which then you can reload the game.


* Next update will have fix the if game has no winner. UPDATED to fix no Winner
* Deploy: https://infallible-bassi-cc7a10.netlify.app
